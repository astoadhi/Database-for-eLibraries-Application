# Digital-database-for-library
Libraries have traditionally been stores of knowledge, promoting study and cultural exchange. Traditionally, libraries used physical catalogs, frequently in card form, to manage their collections. These catalogs required painstaking manual updating and had restricted search capabilities. As technology advanced, the need for a more efficient and comprehensive method to manage library resources became clear. 

Library databases were developed in the mid-twentieth century, coinciding with the emergence of computer technology. Early library databases were frequently mainframe-based and exclusively accessible to librarians. However, with the introduction of personal computers and the internet, library databases became more user-friendly and available to the general public.

## Database Objectives
1.	Design a relational database for a library management system. The application oversees multiple libraries, each hosting a diverse collection of books with varying quantities available for borrowing. Users can borrow or place holds on books (when the book is not immediately available for borrowing). 
2.	Populate the database with dummy data, to check if the database good or not. 
3.	Retrieve data to answer specific questions about the library's collection and circulation.

Mission Statement: The mission of this e-library application is to provide a user-friendly platform for managing multiple libraries, storing book information, and facilitating user registration, loan, and hold systems, while ensuring efficient tracking and management of book collections and user interactions.
