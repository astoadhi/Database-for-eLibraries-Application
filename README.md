# Digital-database-for-library
This project aims to design and implement a digital database for a library, migrating its collection from physical books to digital formats. The goal is to create a robust and scalable database that can store, organize, and retrieve digital content, providing features for searching, browsing, and accessing the digital materials.

# Database Objectives

1.	Design a relational database for a library management system. The application oversees multiple libraries, each hosting a diverse collection of books with varying quantities available for borrowing. Users can borrow or place holds on books (when the book is not immediately available for borrowing). 
2.	Populate the database with dummy data, to check if the database good or not. 
3.	Retrieve data to answer specific questions about the library's collection and circulation.

Mission Statement: The mission of this e-library application is to provide a user-friendly platform for managing multiple libraries, storing book information, and facilitating user registration, loan, and hold systems, while ensuring efficient tracking and management of book collections and user interactions.
